# Hey, I'm Meet 👋
I am a Front-end Developer from India dedicated to making the web a little more beautiful than it was yesterday. I’ve moved beyond just "learning tools" to building products and exploring the world of agentic development.

## 🚀 Projects & Products

### [CalcSuite](https://calcsuite.in)
An open-source suite of high-utility online calculators designed for speed and precision. 
*Building the future of simple web utilities.*

### Glaze (Coming Soon) 🦄
A high-end "designer layer" for status pages. Integrating interactive motion and premium UI/UX into services like UptimeRobot and Status.io to make system monitoring look as good as the product itself.

## ✍️ Writing
I occasionally share my journey and technical insights on [DEV Community](https://dev.to/meetbhalodiya).

* [Don't be limited to a dev](https://dev.to/meetbhalodiya/how-not-to-stay-an-only-developer-person-4h8l)
* [Understanding Time zone](https://dev.to/meetbhalodiya/understanding-time-zones-4dpc)
* [How is it to become a self-taught developer](https://dev.to/meetbhalodiya/how-is-it-to-become-a-self-taught-developer-of6)

## 🛠️ What I'm Up To
- **Currently:** Diving deep into agentic development and autonomous workflows.
- **Collaborations:** Open to high-impact React JS projects or design-heavy front-end work.
- **Fun Fact:** Strawberry is not a berry, but a watermelon is. 🍉
